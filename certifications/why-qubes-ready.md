<h2>Qubes x Ready: Business Case</h2>  

Hardware Compatability Lists are hard work:  
[Coreboot - Retired HCL](https://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Chipsets_and_Devices)  
[Qubes - relying upon user submissions, leading to inaccurate and missing information](https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/)  

Even what was intended to be a simple, short list of laptops that 'just work', has [turned into a complex project](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/short-list-of-laptops-desktops-that-work-well-with-qubes-os/5197) which is evolving beyond what the author(s) envisaged.  

Suffice to say - Hardware Compatability Lists are **a-lot** of work.  

But: we need a solution that enables users to find hardware that works out-of-the-box.  
If HCL is not viable, then what is?  

**This is where Qubes x Ready comes in**. 

Qubes x Ready not only reduces the time-burden, but also increases revenue.  

<h2>The Roadmap</h2>  

By initially targetting 'qualified^1' manufacturers (those with overlapping market), we will secure high-value case-studies for Qubes x Ready.  
These case-studies, in addition to the increase in community-size, will lead to a broader-base of manufacturers whom we can on-board to Qubes x Ready.  
This positive cycle of growth will continue, bringing wider benefits:  
As more hardware is Qubes x Ready - manufacturers whom are not certified are more likely to support Qubes anyway (due to proven benefits).  
This wider compatability will lead to more users and a bigger community (positive cycle of growth).  

**Qubes x Ready is pivotal to the greater certification program**:  
Qubes x Ready is the ingition required to accelerate the Certification Program to its full potential.  
Currently, the program has only 2 manufacturers - both of whom resell very old hardware at very high prices.    
It is clear the current program is lacking in proven benefits to manufacturers.  
Qubes x Ready will bring the manufacturer partners, hardware compatability and users required to reap the benefits from certifications such as Qubes Gold certified.
